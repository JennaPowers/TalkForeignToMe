# TalkForeignToMe

Have you ever wanted a quick and efficent way to practice your favorite language?
It seems like most foreign language applications start at ground zero, but how many
times can we learn how to say "Hello" and "Good morning," until we've exhausted our
brain with information that we've already learned...

This app allows you to hone your vocabulary skills, so that you're constantly expanding
your skills and able to recognize more of what the natives are speaking! 

Now offering: Russian, French, Korean, Japanese, Italian (more languages coming soon)
